title: Uninstall Launcher Kit

## Some notes before uninstalling
If you are uninstalling the Launcher Kit in an attempt to solve a problem, please read through the other support pages or ask for help first. Most likely, your issue will not be resolved by simply reinstalling the Launcher Kit.

If you are attempting to remove all mods and return to "vanilla" Spore, you do not need to uninstall the entire Launcher Kit. You only need to uninstall all mods using the Easy Uninstaller.

## Uninstalling all mods
You must uninstall all mods **before** uninstalling the Launcher Kit.

Open the Easy Uninstaller, check the box next to each mod, and click "Uninstall Selected".

Do not uninstall the Launcher Kit unless no mods are listed in the Easy Uninstaller.

## Finding and removing Launcher Kit
You will need to know where the Launcher Kit is installed to. By default, this is `%programdata%\Spore ModAPI Launcher Kit`, but you may have changed it during installation.

If you cannot find the Launcher Kit files, press Win+R and type in `notepad "%appdata%\Spore ModAPI Launcher\path.info"`. A notepad window will open, containing the location of the Launcher Kit files.

Once located, you can simply delete the `Spore ModAPI Launcher Kit` folder.

The Launcher Kit also stores a small amount of non-essential data in `%appdata%\Spore ModAPI Launcher`. You can also delete this `Spore ModAPI Launcher` folder.

The Launcher Kit does not store data in any other locations, nor does it use the Windows Registry, so deleting these two folders is all that is needed to fully remove it.
