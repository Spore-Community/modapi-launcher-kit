You may also see "Configuration Script Failed" along with this error. The two errors are related.

## Steam users
Please launch Spore Galactic Adventures once from Steam before using the Launcher Kit. Afterwards, you should always use the ModAPI Launcher instead of launching from Steam.

The error happens because Steam does not finish installing games until the first time they are launched. As a result, the game cannot start because it is not fully installed, and the Launcher Kit is unable to detect that the game is installed.

This also eliminates an issue where you may be prompted to choose where the game is installed when using the Launcher kit. You should not continue to receive this prompt.
