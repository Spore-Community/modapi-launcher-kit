This error seems to occur when Spore is installed to a drive other than the C:\ drive.

Unfortunately, we do not have any fix for this error, aside from reinstalling the game onto the C:\ drive.

Please [ask for help](/support) if you are receiving this error when Spore is already installed on the C:\ drive. Include a screenshot of the error.

## Reinstalling on C:\ drive
- [Back up your save data](game-save-data)
- Uninstall all mods using the Easy Uninstaller
- If the Launcher Kit is installed onto a drive other than the C:\ drive, [uninstall it](uninstall-lk)
- Uninstall the game, as well as Galactic Adventures, and Creepy & Cute if installed
- Reinstall onto the C:\ drive
- Reinstall the Launcher Kit onto the C:\ drive (default location is recommended)
- Reinstall your mods
- Check if your save data is present, and restore it if needed

Do not attempt to move the game files manually or using other apps (such as Steam's feature to move game). These are known to cause problems.

Do not reinstall the game until it has been properly uninstalled first.
