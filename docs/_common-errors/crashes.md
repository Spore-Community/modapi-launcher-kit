title: Game Crashes
---
If your game freezes or crashes (i.e. "SPORE Galactic Adventures has stopped responding"), it may be due to a bug in the game itself, or due to a mod.

See [Improving Game Stability](improving-stability) for general recommendations that may help fix some crashes.

If you encounter crashes at startup, or at *specific* points in the game, it may be due to a bug in a mod. Try uninstalling mods (aside from SporeCrashFix) using the Easy Uninstaller and see if the crash persists. You may need to use trial and error to figure out which mod is causing the crash. In particular, ensure that you do not have any [outdated mods](outdated-mods).

If you have identified which mod is causing the crash, you will need to contact the developer of that mod to report it. Mod developers can generally be contacted on Discord or GitHub.

For crashes that occur even when SporeCrashFix is the only installed mod, it is likely a bug in the game itself. Specific crashes may be added to SporeCrashFix if the cause of the crash can be identified and fixed.

In any case, you can [ask for help](support) - please make sure to include a screenshot of the Easy Uninstaller showing your full mod list, as well as exactly when the crash occurs.
