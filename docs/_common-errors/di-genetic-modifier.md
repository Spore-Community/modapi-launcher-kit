title: Overlapping outfitters in Planner
---
In the Tribe, City, or Colony Planner, the outfitter tab may show two thumbnails that are overlapping, preventing access to the outfitter. This is a bug in Dark Injection.

Please see the section on Dark Injection [here](outdated-mods). In particular, you must disable the Genetic Modifier option to fix this specific issue.

If you absolutely need to have the Genetic Modifier feature working, you can find a fix in the Spore Modding Community Discord [here](https://discord.com/channels/368198218632396810/485195883198283807/732943635959513108).
